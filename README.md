# Currency Converter Task

Using C# and any Azure resource types you think appropriate, build an API that allows end-users to convert an amount from one currency to another.

Using any appropriate front-end framework, expose the API functionality to users.

Users should be able to select a source currency, enter an amount and select a destination currency. The app should then convert the amount to the destination currency and display the converted amount.

The software should be delivered as a link to a GitHub repo we can review.
